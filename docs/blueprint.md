- Accent color: Complementary orange (#F2994A) used to draw attention to interactive elements and CTAs, creating contrast and visual interest.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a techy, modern aesthetic, ideal for headings and short text.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) to complement 'Space Grotesk,' offering excellent readability for larger bodies of text. This is chosen over using 'Space Grotesk' as the sole font to ensure optimal readability in more extensive content blocks.
- Use modern, minimalist icons that align with the tech-forward feel. Icons should be clear, geometric, and functional, serving to guide users through the interface.
- Employ a grid-based layout with ample white space to give a structured and airy feel. Utilize responsive breakpoints to ensure adaptability across various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.
